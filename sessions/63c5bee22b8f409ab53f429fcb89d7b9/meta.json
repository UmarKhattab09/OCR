Blinking helps to moisten and\nprotect the surface of the eye by spreading\ntears over the cornea. It also helps to clear\ndebris and foreign particles from the eye.\n\nThe human body has about 600 to 700\nmuscles. The number of muscles an\nindividual has can vary due to factors\nsuch as age, gender, and overall health.\n\nThese muscles are responsible for various\nfunctions such as movement, posture, and\nfacial expressions."
