  "Here's the extracted text from the handwriting in the image:\n\nHandwriting Practice\nDid you know?\n\nThe average person blinks about 15-20 times per minute or about 20,000 times per day. Blinking helps to moisten and protect the surface of the eye by spreading tears over the cornea. It also helps to clear debris and foreign particles from the eye.\n\nThe human body has about 600 to 700 muscles. The number of muscles an individual has can vary due to factors such as age, gender, and overall health. \n\nThese muscles are responsible for various functions such as movement, posture, and facial expressions."
